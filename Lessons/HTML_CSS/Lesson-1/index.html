    <h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
    <h3>Down the Rabbit-Hole</h3>

    <p> <b>Alice</b> was beginning to get very tired of sitting <mark>by her sister on the bank</mark>,
        and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister
        was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use
        of a book,” thought Alice “without pictures or conversations?”</p>

    <p> <u>So shewas considering in her own mind</u> (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy
        and
        stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the
        daisies, when suddenly a White <s>Rabbit with pink eyes</s> ran close by her.</p>

    <p> <i>There was nothing so very remarkable in that</i> ; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear
        the
        Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to
        her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit
        actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her
        feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had.</p>
